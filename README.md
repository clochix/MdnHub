# MdnHub

Get the content of some sections of the awesome documentation available on [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/) and save it in local storage for offline use.

/!\ The application need to scrap content from the MDN website, which can use a lot of bandwidth, and harm your browser. Scraping of JavaScript documentation is very slow, so itâ€™s probably buggy.

You can manually add content into the local database by calling the spider from a JavaScript console:

    spider("https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB", "IndexedDB");

This will get all link containing IndexedDB from the main IDB page.
